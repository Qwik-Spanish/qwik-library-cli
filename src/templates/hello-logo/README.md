## Project Structure

Inside your project, you'll see the following directories and files:

```
├── public/
│   └── ...
└── src/
    ├── components/
    │   └── ...
    └── index.ts
```

- `src/components`: Recommended directory for components.

- `index.ts`: The entry point of your component library, make sure all the public components are exported from this file.

- `root.tsx`: We can use this file to test the components created while we are developing to facilitate the process and make testing more agile, before packaging it for distribution. To test it we only have to execute the command `npm start` or `npm dev`.

## After developing the library

I recommended read [this article](https://medium.com/@mugan86/qwik-creando-librer%C3%ADa-y-publicar-en-npm-428afd4cf3ff) (in Spanish, comming soon in English).
